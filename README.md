### Visualization App Purpose

Millions of movies are published on a variety of channels; however, filtering excellent movies could be time-consuming. If we could provide a list of popular movies based on customers' preferences and illustrate approximation of box offices from different dimensions, they will save a large amount of time on searching for high-quality movies. To solve this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows movie enthusiasts to explore the top 10 popular movies, box offices and other relevant information. Our app can be served as a great exploratory tool for people who like visualization and friendly-user-interface to extract various data at the same time with minimum efforts to select the filters.

The full proposal can be found in [our proposal file](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/movielover_r/blob/main/docs/proposal.md).

### Usage Instructions

Users can select year range and multiple genres in the sidebar to filter out movie data to visualize in the dashboard. The dashboard contains three graphics (bar chart, line chart and scatter plot). A detailed introduction to the graphics can be found in the followed section.

Our app support interactivity between graphs. Detailed instruction as follows:
- Bar chart: Total US revenue of a movie genre will be shown by hovering over the bar. Also, users can click a genre to make it highlighted and the other two graphs will change automatically to specify a genre as well.
- Line chart: Average US revenue of a movie genre in the year will be shown by hovering over the point on the line. Moreover, users can select an interval to highlight a more specified period.
- Scatter plot: IMDB rating and duration of a movie will be shown by hovering over the point. Interval selection is also supported in the scatterplot to serve presentation needs. 

### App Description

`Movie Lover` is a dashboard designed to help movie enthusiasts explore various information (depending on the filter constraints) about movies, such as the US gross revenue for different movies genres (in a bar chart), the relationship between runtime and rating (scatter plot), as well as trends of average gross revenue by genres in selected year range. Users can filter out the movies' release years using the slider bar underneath the landing page's title. Underneath the slider, there is a click box, where users can select the movies genres they are interested in. The line chart and scatter plot will be shown on the right side above the bar chart.
