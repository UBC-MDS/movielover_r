# Milestone 4 Reflection


### Accomplishments of dashboard deliverables

- Both the DashPy and DashR dashboards display 3 intuitive illustrations, including a scatter plot, bar chart and line chart. As mentioned in the peer review, the app is clean and intuitive to use. The filtering options are straightforward to control with a range slider and checklist. Therefore, massive statistical, coding knowledge or extensive industry background are not necessarily required for using the app.
- For DashPy, the 3 graphs are tightly linked to each other as the app supports various interactivity. It provides flexibility to present different characteristics of each selected genre.
- The usage instructions in the tip box are simple and intuitive.
- The app was deployed on Heroku. So, other users are welcome to use the app for their purpose by accessing the webserver.
- Each plot demonstrates different information of movies with minimal overlaps.


### Differences between DashPy and DashR

- DashPy allows further interactions between plots (eg. selecting a genre on bar plot would dim the other genreâ€™s information on plots). Such interactivity could be further developed in DashR when there is more time. 
- Exporting individual plots is available in DashR but not DashPy. DashPy can be refined with multiple code functions if time permits.  
- Plots are in different color themes for DashPy and DashR apps. 


### Limitations and future improvements

- Minor finetuning to the background color and overall web aesthetic design could be done (eg. aligning color themes for DashPy and DashR). 
- We agree with one of the peer review comments that the app does not provide a list of movies based on users' genre preference, of which a movie enthusiast would be interested in. We could add a tab feature to display more plots or tables to avoid crowding. (eg. A new tab `Top 10 movies` for user to pick a genre from a dropdown filter and show a table of top 10 movie titles).
- There is a simple tips box on interactivity but for those who are not familiar with online tools, we could provide a link to a step-by-step user guide.
- DashPy can be finetuned to allow exporting individual plots instead of all three together for more flexibility.
- For future development, we may consider adding a couple of advanced graphics as optional plots, which provide more information to different users.
- To add more flexibility in filtering, we may include more filtering options, such as MPAA Ratings or Distributors.
- Our team only used several features in the data set. Perhaps, we can incorporate more features to generate more meaningful insights for movie enthusiasts.
- As mentioned in Milestone 2 reflection, if time permits, we would look for a more updated data set with movie data beyond year 2016 and a more balanced number of movies for each genre for a more comprehensive analysis.
- To extend our user pool from North America to the international market, we could include the feature `Worldwide Revenue`.
